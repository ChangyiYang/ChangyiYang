# Hi All! 👋 I'm Changyi Yang

## About Me
I received my undergraduate degree from The Chinese University of Hong Kong, 
Shenzhen, and I'm currently pursuing my graduate studies at CMU.

## Background
I started my journey as a full-stack engineer, learning a complete set of front-
end and back-end development skills including:
• Java Spring Boot
• React
• Full-stack development technologies

This summer, I'm working as an SDE intern at Amazon.

## Current Focus
Currently, my interests have shifted to AI infrastructure. I'm very fortunate to 
have joined the [SGLang](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang) RL team. 

I'm primarily working on rollout-related tasks in:
• [VERL](https://github.com/volcengine/verl)
• [AReaL](https://github.com/inclusionAI/AReaL)
